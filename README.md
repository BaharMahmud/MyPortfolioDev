## Description

This portfolio application was developed and designed to showcase my web applications, resume, and skills to potential employers, clients, and interested parties. React was created by Facebook developers and helps simplify the process of building interactive and dynamic user interfaces by providing a component-based structure, efficient rendering through the virtual DOM, and a declarative syntax. It operates via a one page application, but gives the user experience of multiple page functionality.

As it stands, this application is all front-end. However I will be looking to add a backend framework so that I can receive messages via my contact page. React allows for developer flexibility and seems to still be on the rise in popularity. React offers developers numerous options in choosing other back-end frameworks and middleware options as it is a library focused on the View layer only therefore allowing developers to build UI components leaving the choice of other libraries or tools for additional functionalities open ended.

Challenges faced when building this application resulted mainly from mixing CSS and implementing the useState functionality on the nav-links.

This application is very user intuitive, just visit the site (https://main--singular-malasada-2a036b.netlify.app/), navigate through different pages using the links in the nav-bar, and view desired content.

## Suggested Future Development

- Dark Mode Toggle
- Continued display and UI development
- Hamburger menu implemented on the navbar
- Potential to add additional pages for showcasing photos, travel blog, and book list
- Add backend and middleware so users can contact me (Express/MySQL, or GraphQL/MongoDB)
- Add addition of useEffect
- Including unit testing
